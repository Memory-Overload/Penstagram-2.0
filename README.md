# Penstagram 2.0
## What is Penstagram 2.0?
Well, on *The Owl House*, Penstagram 2.0 (or 0.2 or no release suffix, depending on the episode) is a social media app on a person's scroll where the general populace of the Boiling Isles can share posts in the forms of text, picture, and video about their day-to-day life. Alongside public posts, users can also have private conversations between themself and another user.

In terms of color scheme, the main palette consists of a purple border on a white backdrop. with the Penstagram logo at the top of the screem, accompanied by a crystal ball emoji and a burning match emoji. In the bottom rught, a cauldron emokji can also be seen, which is likely what a user taps if they want to cook up a new post. *Eh, see what I did there? Sorry, I'll stop.*

## Okay, but why post this on AO3?
Well, the long and short of it is that I wanted to do something that can combine my two passinos: coding and the funny gay owl show. Plus, AO3's limitations on accepted HTML tags means that I also have a challenge of doing all this a limited tag set.
