# Penstagram 2.0
## What is Penstagram 2.0?
Well, on *The Owl House*, Penstagram 2.0 (or .02, or no release suffix, depending on the episode) is a social media app on a person's scroll where the general populace of the Boiling Isles can share posts in the forms of text, picture, and video about their day-to-day life. Alongside public posts, users can also have private conversations between themself and another user.

In terms of color scheme, the main palette consists of a purple border on a white backdrop. with the Penstagram logo at the top of the screem, accompanied by a crystal ball emoji and a burning match emoji. In the bottom rught, a cauldron emokji can also be seen, which is likely what a user taps if they want to cook up a new post. *Eh, see what I did there? Sorry, I'll stop.*

## Okay, but why post this on AO3?
Well, the long and short of it is that I wanted to do something that can combine my two passinos: coding and the funny gay owl show. Plus, AO3's limitations on accepted HTML tags means that I also have a challenge of doing all this a limited tag set. (The most annoying of all: no buttons.)

## Can I Make My Own Version of Penstagram 2.0?
Be my guest! I'm making this under a GNU General Public License 3.0 (GPL 3.0, for short), which means that anyone and everyone can copy, modify, or do whatever to this project. Heck, you can even sell this as a product, or even patent it!

To make a lot of legalese short, go wild and have fun with this. Make it your own!
